### Definition
Computational biology happens at the intersection of maths, computers, and biology!

Computational Biology is a field of study that seeks to build models of biological systems using computational techniques.

## Intersecting Areas
Since computational biology derives from multiple disciplines, it can seem to be similar to some other fields which also derive from those same disciplines. However, it is a different field from:
1. *Bioinformatics*: Bioinformatics as a field tries to build systems to efficiently store, label, and retrieve biological data.
2. *Biological Computing*: Biological Computing as a field focuses on building computer from biological entities.

> You can think of bioinformatics as the analogue to databases and data structures from computer science, and computational biology to be analogous to Algorithms.

## Subfields
Computational Biology is a broad discipline and encompasses various focus areas:
1. ***Computational Anatomy*** studies anatomy at tissue and organ subunit scales through  computational methods.
2. ***Mathematical Biology*** uses mathematical models to examine systems in living organisms.
3. ***Computational Biomodeling*** build computer models and simulations of biological systems.
4. ***Systems Biology*** refers to modeling biological systems and their interactions to understand properties that emerge bottom-up.
5. ***Computational Phylogenetics*** tries to reconstruct the phylogeny from DNA.
6. ***Population Genetics*** focuses on using DNA to understand populations and their history.
7. ***Computational Genomics*** studies cellular and organismal genomes through computational methods.
8. ***Computational Neuroscience*** studies brain function and the nervous systems through the lens of information.
9. ***Computational Neuropsychiatry*** uses modeling to study brain mechanisms of mental disorders.
10. ***Computational Pharmacology*** studies the inter-relation of genotypes, diseases, and drugs.
11. ***Computational Oncology*** studies cancer through algorithmic approaches.
