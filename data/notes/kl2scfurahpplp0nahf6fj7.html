<p>Computational biology happens at the intersection of maths, computers, and biology!</p>
<p>Computational Biology is a field of study that seeks to build models of biological systems using computational techniques.</p>

<p>Since computational biology derives from multiple disciplines, it can seem to be similar to some other fields which also derive from those same disciplines. However, it is a different field from:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Bioinformatics</em>: Bioinformatics as a field tries to build systems to efficiently store, label, and retrieve biological data.</li>
<li><em>Biological Computing</em>: Biological Computing as a field focuses on building computer from biological entities.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>You can think of bioinformatics as the analogue to databases and data structures from computer science, and computational biology to be analogous to Algorithms.</p>

<p>Computational Biology is a broad discipline and encompasses various focus areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Computational Anatomy</em></strong> studies anatomy at tissue and organ subunit scales through  computational methods.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mathematical Biology</em></strong> uses mathematical models to examine systems in living organisms.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Biomodeling</em></strong> build computer models and simulations of biological systems.</li>
<li><strong><em>Systems Biology</em></strong> refers to modeling biological systems and their interactions to understand properties that emerge bottom-up.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Phylogenetics</em></strong> tries to reconstruct the phylogeny from DNA.</li>
<li><strong><em>Population Genetics</em></strong> focuses on using DNA to understand populations and their history.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Genomics</em></strong> studies cellular and organismal genomes through computational methods.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Neuroscience</em></strong> studies brain function and the nervous systems through the lens of information.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Neuropsychiatry</em></strong> uses modeling to study brain mechanisms of mental disorders.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Pharmacology</em></strong> studies the inter-relation of genotypes, diseases, and drugs.</li>
<li><strong><em>Computational Oncology</em></strong> studies cancer through algorithmic approaches.</li>
